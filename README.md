**The easiest way to let your AI talk to your game hacking tools.**

**What is this?**  
NexusRE is a bridge that connects AI coding assistants (like Cursor, Claude, or Windsurf) directly to your game hacking and reverse engineering tools (like Cheat Engine, IDA Pro, or x64dbg). 

Instead of opening a debugger and staring at memory yourself, you just highlight code in your text editor and tell the AI: *"Hey, look at the game's actual memory and tell me what the value is right here."* The AI will reach into your game, read the memory, and give you the answer.

## 🔥 Why is this awesome?

### 1. The "Game Updated" Auto-Healer 
When a game updates, cheats break because all the memory addresses change. Normally, fixing this means you have to spend several hours manually finding the new addresses.

**With NexusRE:** You tell the AI to fix it. It automatically scans the new game update, finds what changed, and updates your cheat's code for you in a few minutes.

### 2. The Universal Bridge
You don't need to write separate scripts for every tool you use. NexusRE connects your AI to everything at once.

## 🚀 How to Install

We recommend using `uv` (it makes running Python stuff way easier and cleaner).

### Option A: Run it from the folder (Recommended)
If you downloaded this folder directly:
```bash
cd path/to/NexusRE-MCP

# Run this command to automatically connect it to Claude or Cursor:
uv run main.py --install
```

### Option B: Install it globally
If you want to be able to just type `nexusre-mcp` from anywhere on your computer:
```bash
# Easy global install:
uv tool install .
```
Then, just type `nexusre-mcp --install` to connect it to your AI.

**(Optional) Share it with your team:**  
If you want your friends or team to use your server over the internet, run:
```bash
set NEXUSRE_API_KEY=your_secret_password
nexusre-mcp --transport sse --port 8080
```

## 🔌 What tools does it talk to?

NexusRE connects to backend files in the `adapters/` folder. Right now, it supports:

* **IDA Pro & Ghidra** (For looking at dead game code)
* **x64dbg & Cheat Engine** (For looking at live game memory)
* **Frida** (For advanced live code messing)
* **Kernel Drivers & DMA (2nd PC hacking)** (For bypassing Anti-Cheats like EAC or BattlEye without getting caught)
* **ReClass.NET** (For reading memory structures)

### What else can it do?
* **Auto-Dump C++ Code:** It can automatically read a game (like Fortnite or a Unity game) and write an entire C++ cheat SDK template for you.
* **Network Sniffing:** Tell the AI to intercept packets going to the game server.
* **Math Decryption:** If a game encrypts a memory address, the AI can automatically figure out the math formula to decrypt it for you. 

## 🛠 Setting up the Backend Plugins

To let NexusRE talk to your specific tools, you need to run a small background plugin in them. Here is how to set up each one:

### 🦇 IDA Pro
1. Find the `ida_backend_plugin.py` file in the `plugins/ida/` folder.
2. Copy it into your IDA Plugins directory (usually `%APPDATA%\Hex-Rays\IDA Pro\plugins\` or the `plugins` folder inside your IDA install directory).
3. Restart IDA. The server will start automatically in the background.

### 🐉 Ghidra
1. Open Ghidra and navigate to your project.
2. Open the **Script Manager** (`Window -> Script Manager`).
3. Click the "Manage Script Directories" icon and add the `plugins/ghidra/` path, or simply create a new Python script and paste the contents of `ghidra_backend_plugin.py`.
4. Run the script. Watch the console for *"Starting background HTTP server"*. *(Note: Requires PyGhidra).*

### 🐞 x64dbg
1. Install [x64dbgpy](https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbgpy) to enable Python support.
2. Open x64dbg and navigate to the Scripts tab.
3. Execute the `plugins/x64dbg/x64dbg_backend_plugin.py` script to start the backend listener.

### 🥷 Binary Ninja
1. Open your Binary Ninja plugins folder by clicking `Edit -> Open Plugin Folder...`
2. Copy the `plugins/binja/binja_backend_plugin.py` script into the plugins directory.
3. Restart Binja. The server will automatically initialize in the background.

### 💉 Cheat Engine
1. Open Cheat Engine and attach to your target process.
2. Press `Ctrl+Alt+L` to open the Lua Engine.
3. Open or paste the contents of `plugins/ce/ce_backend_plugin.lua`.
4. Click **Execute** to start the internal CE HTTP server.
